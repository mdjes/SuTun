SuTun joins your Linux servers into **one encrypted private network** with [EasyTier](https://github.com/EasyTier/EasyTier), forwards ports between them, and gives you **a web panel to run it all**, in English or Persian. Install it with one command, create a mesh on the first server, and add the others with an invite code.

## ✨ Features

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="33%" valign="top">
      <h3>🌐 Private mesh</h3>
      Every server gets a private address like <code>10.144.144.2</code> and reaches the others directly, encrypted.
    </td>
    <td width="33%" valign="top">
      <h3>🛰️ Nine transports</h3>
      TCP, UDP, WebSocket, QUIC, FakeTCP, and ICMP or PCK links by <a href="https://github.com/AminMGMT/BackPack">BackPack</a> for networks where little gets through.
    </td>
    <td width="33%" valign="top">
      <h3>🖥️ Web panel</h3>
      Live peers, latency and traffic, ping and speed tests between any two servers. Light and dark, English and Persian.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="33%" valign="top">
      <h3>🔀 Port forwarding</h3>
      Realm, HAProxy, GOST or kernel iptables, from a single port to whole ranges and port maps.
    </td>
    <td width="33%" valign="top">
      <h3>⚡ SafeSync</h3>
      Change shared settings on every server at once. A server that loses its peers rolls back on its own.
    </td>
    <td width="33%" valign="top">
      <h3>🔐 Secure by default</h3>
      One-time login links, optional password-free sign-in, rate limiting and free HTTPS with Let's Encrypt.
    </td>
  </tr>

## 🚀 Quick install

Run this on each **Debian or Ubuntu** server, as `root`:

```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdjes/SuTun/main/sutun.sh)
```

1. **Open the login link** the installer prints. It works once, within 60 minutes.
2. **Create a mesh** on the first server and copy its invite code.
3. **Join the other servers** with that code. They show up under **Servers** within seconds.

Need details? Follow the [getting started guide](https://mdjes.github.io/SuTun/start/introduction/). New login link any time: `sudo sutun token`.
